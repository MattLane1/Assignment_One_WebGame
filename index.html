                <p>You see swirling mists that slowly form into a pale face. In a deep, ominous voice, it speaks. "You...you are not supposed to be here, its not safe!. 
                   You need to find your way out, quickly! Go!"</p>
                <p>You awaken groggily, and find yourself laying on a sandy beach. You realise you are bleeding from your head, but have no idea why, or where you are.
                   The last thing you remember was...was...you have no idea. Your mind is blank.</p>
                <br />
