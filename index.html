                    You see swirling mists that slowly form into a pale face. In a deep, ominous voice, it speaks. "You...you are not supposed to be here, its not safe!
                    You need to find your way out, quickly! Go!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    You awaken groggily, and find yourself laying on a sandy beach. You realize you are bleeding from your head, but have no idea why, or where you are.
                    The last thing you remember was...was...you have no idea. Your mind is blank.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>You slowly climb to your feet, the ominous words still ringing in your ears. The sun is hot and beating down, it makes you feel dizzy.</p>
                <p>
                    As you look around you see a dark cave to the north, it looks cool, but very dark and uninviting. To the west the beach continues banked on one side by
                    thick jungle, and on the other by the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>The way to the east is covered with jagged rocks, but you think you can pick your way through them. To the south is endless ocean. </p>
                <br />
                <p>Which way do you go?</p>
                <p><a href="#north">Head north to the dark cave.</a></p>
                <p>or</p>

                <p>or</p>
                <p><a href="#east">Pick your way through the rocks.</a></p>
