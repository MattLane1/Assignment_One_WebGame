                    You see swirling mists that slowly form into a pale face. In a deep, ominous voice, it speaks. "You...you are not supposed to be here, its not safe!
                    You need to find your way out, quickly! Go!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    You awaken groggily, and find yourself laying on a sandy beach. You realize you are bleeding from your head, but have no idea why, or where you are.
                    The last thing you remember was...was...you have no idea. Your mind is blank.
                </p>
                <br />

            <div class="slide-text">
                <p>You slowly climb to your feet, the ominous words still ringing in your ears. The sun is hot and beating down, it makes you feel dizzy.</p>
                <p>
                    As you look around you see a dark cave to the north, it looks cool, but very dark and uninviting. To the west the beach continues banked on one side by
                    thick jungle, and on the other by the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>The way to the east is covered with jagged rocks, but you think you can pick your way through them. To the south is endless ocean. </p>

                <p>You walk northward, towad the dark cave. The cool air rolls out to greet you, it feels so nice on your sun baked skin. It is dark inside, far too dark to see. If you put your hand to the wall, and walk slowly, you think you might make it though.</p>
                <p>From somewhere deep in the cave, you hear a deep but almost inaudible growl...it must be the wind.</p>

                    You are back where you woke up. The blood from your head still stains the sand, though the waves hitting the shore slowly claim it. As you look around you see a dark cave to the north, it looks cool, but very dark and uninviting. To the west the beach continues banked on one side by
                    thick jungle, and on the other by the ocean.

                <p>Suddenly, you notice something shiney rolling back and forth in the waves, there is no way to tell for sure from here. The way to it is trecherous, the waves crash into the rocks, making them slippery. </p>
                <p>There is a stick laying to your right. Maybe you could use it to pull the object toward you.</p>

                <p>To the left, is a thick, lush jungle. The canopy offers shade, and you may even be able to find water, but you also know jungles can be dangerous.</p>
                <p>To the right is the ocean, endless water. Maybe a swim would help cool you?</p>

You notice however, the water around you...looks red. The blood from your head is washing off into the water. At that moment, you see the fin coming toward you, your blood is bringing in a shark! You scramble to shore just in time. </p>
